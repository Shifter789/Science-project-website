            <h2>Super Nova</h2>
            <p>What happened: A star in the Milky Way exploded in a supernova. This explosion released a huge amount of energy into space</p>
            <p>Why it matters: The energy from the supernova disturbed a nearby cloud of gas and dust, starting the process of solar system formation.</p>
            <p>Science connection: This shows energy transfer and how events in space can affect other objects far away</p>

            <h2>Collapse of the Gas and Dust Cloud</h2>
            <p>What happened: The cloud of gas and dust became unstable. Gravity pulled the material inward, causing the cloud to collapse and flatten into a spinning disc</p>
            <p>Why it matters: Gravity caused the particles to move closer together, which allowed the solar system to begin forming in an organized structure</p>
            <p>Science connection: This step connects to gravity and motion, since the cloud collapses and spins at the same time.</p>

            <h2>Formation of the Sun</h2>
            <p>What happened: The center of the disc became extremely hot and dense. Pressure and heat built up until a star formed</p>
            <p>Why it matters: The Sun formed first and became the center of the solar system. its gravity controls the motion of the planets.</p>
            <p>Science connection: This relates to physics, especially pressure,heat, and nuclear energy</p>

        <div class="content">

            <h2>Formation of Planets and Moons</h2>
            <p>What happened: Leftover gas and dust began sticking together due to gravity. These small pieces slowly grew into planets and moons.</p>
            <p>Why it matters: This process explains how small particles can become large objects over millions of years.</p>
            <p>Science connection: This step shows gravity, time scales, and how matter can combine to form larger structures.</p>

        <div class="content">

            <h2>Formation of the Inner Rocky Planets</h2>
            <p>What happened: Close to the Sun, temperatures were very high. Only rock and metal could stay solid, forming Mercury, venus, Earth, and Mars.</p>
            <p>Why it matters: This explains why the inner planets are rocky and do not have thick gas layers.</p>
            <p>Science connection: This connects to states of matter and how temperature affects what materials can exist.</p>

    <!--BOX 6-->
    <div class="container right">

        <div class="content">

            <h2>Formation of the Outer Gas and ice giants</h2>
            <p>What happened: Farther from the Sun, temperatures were cooler. Gas and ice were able to collect, forming Jupiter, Saturn, uranus, and Neptune.</p>
            <p>Why it matters: This explains why outer planets are much larger and made mostly of gas and ice.</p>
            <p>Science connection: This step relates to temperature differences, gravity, and planet composition.</p>
